// Description:
// ------------
// The Mandelbrot set is a complex set of points that forms a fractal, named after
// mathematician Beno√Æt Mandelbrot. It consists of all complex numbers c for which
// the function z_(n+1) = z_(n)^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z_(0) = 0.
// The set is typically visualized in the complex plane, displaying intricate,
// self-similar patterns. It exhibits a distinctive shape with a large central "bulb"
// and smaller surrounding "satellite" bulbs, revealing more detailed structures at
// increasing magnification. The Mandelbrot set is an iconic example of how simple
// mathematical rules can generate incredibly complex and beautiful patterns.
