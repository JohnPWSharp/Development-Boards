# The STC8H8K64U Family of 8-bit 8051 USB2.0 Microcontrollers
## Overview
The STC8H8K64U series is a cost-effective family of 8-bit microcontrollers with an ultra-high speed 8051 core that is compatible with the MCS51 instruction set. These microcontrollers offer an average instruction speed that is approximately 12 times faster than the traditional 8051, with most instructions requiring only one clock cycle for execution. They support clock frequencies of up to 40MHz, operate within a voltage range of 1.9V to 5.5V, and come equipped with standard peripherals such as a 12-bit ADC, analog comparator, multiple timers, PWM, DMA, UART, SPI, and I2C. Additionally, these microcontrollers feature a built-in bootloader, allowing firmware to be uploaded directly via the native full-speed USB 2.0 interface without the need for an extra programming device.

- Factory-built-in USB bootloader

# Compiling, Programming and Debugging
## SDCC Toolchain
For compiling install the SDCC compiler. On Linux (Debian-based), this can be done with the following command:
```
sudo apt install build-essential sdcc
```

## Factory built-in USB Bootlader
The MCU has an embedded bootloader with USB interface, which can be used to upload firmware.

The Python tool [stc8usb.py](https://github.com/wagiminator/MCU-Flash-Tools) included with the example software can be used for this purpose. In order for this ISP tool to work, Python3 must be installed on your system. To do this, follow these [instructions](https://www.pythontutorial.net/getting-started/install-python/). In addition [pyhidapi](https://pypi.org/project/hid/) must be installed. On Linux (Debian-based), all of this can be done with the following commands:

```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
python3 -m pip install hid
```

Because the USB bootloader functions as a Human Interface Device (HID), there's no need to install drivers. However, Linux doesn't initially grant sufficient permissions to access the bootloader. To resolve this issue, open a terminal and execute the following commands:

```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="34bf", ATTR{idProduct}=="1001", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-STC-ISP.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

You can also utilize the manufacturer's proprietary programming tool, [STC ISP](https://www.stcmicro.com/rjxz.html), for programming the MCU.

To initiate new uploads, the bootloader needs to be manually started. Begin by unplugging the board from the USB port and disconnecting all power sources. Then, press and hold the BOOT button while reconnecting the board to your PC's USB port. This action triggers the chip to enter bootloader mode. Once in this mode, you can release the BOOT button and proceed to upload new firmware via USB.
