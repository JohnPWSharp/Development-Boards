# The STC8H1K08 Family of 8-bit 8051 Microcontrollers
## Overview
The STC8H1K08 series is a cost-effective family of 8-bit microcontrollers with an ultra-high speed 8051 core that is compatible with the MCS51 instruction set. These microcontrollers offer an average instruction speed that is approximately 12 times faster than the traditional 8051, with most instructions requiring only one clock cycle for execution. They support clock frequencies of up to 36MHz, operate within a voltage range of 1.9V to 5.5V, and come equipped with standard peripherals such as a 10-bit ADC, analog comparator, multiple timers, PWM, UART, SPI, and I2C. Additionally, these microcontrollers feature a built-in bootloader, allowing firmware to be uploaded directly via UART without the need for an extra programming device.

## Features

# Compiling, Programming and Debugging
## SDCC Toolchain
For compiling install the SDCC compiler. On Linux (Debian-based), this can be done with the following command:
```
sudo apt install build-essential sdcc
```

## Factory built-in UART Bootlader
The MCU has an embedded bootloader with UART interface, which can be used to upload firmware using the CH340E USB-to-serial adapter integrated into the board.

The Python tool [stc8isp.py](https://github.com/wagiminator/MCU-Flash-Tools) included with the example software can be used for this purpose. In order for this ISP tool to work, Python3 must be installed on your system. To do this, follow these [instructions](https://www.pythontutorial.net/getting-started/install-python/). In addition [PySerial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) must be installed. On Linux (Debian-based), all of this can be done with the following commands:

```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
python3 -m pip install pyserial
```

You can also utilize the manufacturer's proprietary programming tool, [STC ISP](https://www.stcmicro.com/rjxz.html), for programming the MCU.

To upload firmware through the USB port, press and release the DOWNLOAD button when prompted by the ISP software to perform a power cycle. This button interrupts the power supply to the MCU, forcing it to enter bootloader mode.
