# Programming and Debugging
There are two ways to program the microcontroller: via USB using the built-in bootloader and via the serial 2-wire debug interface using a WCH-LinkE programming device.

## Built-in USB Bootloader
### Installing Drivers for the Bootloader
On Linux you do not need to install a driver. However, by default Linux will not expose enough permission to upload your code with the USB bootloader. In order to fix this, open a terminal and run the following commands:

```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="4348", ATTR{idProduct}=="55e0", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch55x.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="55e0", MODE="666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch55x.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

For Windows, you need the [CH372 driver](http://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH372DRV_EXE.html). Alternatively, you can also use the [Zadig Tool](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) to install the correct driver. Here, click "Options" -> "List All Devices" and select the USB module. Then install the libusb-win32 driver. To do this, the board must be connected and the microcontroller must be in bootloader mode.

### Entering Bootloader Mode
The bootloader must be started manually for new uploads. To do this, the board must first be disconnected from the USB port and all voltage sources. Now press the BOOT button and keep it pressed while reconnecting the board to the USB port of your PC. The chip now starts in bootloader mode, the BOOT button can be released and new firmware can be uploaded via USB within the next couple of seconds.

### WCHISPTool
WCH offers the free but closed-source software [WCHISPTool](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/WCHISPTool_Setup_exe.html) to upload firmware with Windows via the USB bootloader.

### chprog
You can also use [chprog](https://pypi.org/project/chprog/), a simple Python command line tool, to flash the microcontroller via the built-in USB bootloader. In order for this tool to work, [Python3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) must be installed on your system. To do this, follow these [instructions](https://www.pythontutorial.net/getting-started/install-python/). Then install chprog via pip. On Linux (Debian-based), all of this can be done with the following commands:

```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip install chprog
```

```
Usage example:
chprog firmware.bin
```

- [wchisp](https://github.com/ch32-rs/wchisp)

## Serial 2-Wire Debug Interface
### WCH-LinkE
To program the microcontroller via the serial debug interface, you will need a special programming device. The [WCH-LinkE](http://www.wch-ic.com/products/WCH-Link.html) (pay attention to the "E" in the name) is a suitable option for this purpose and can be purchased commercially for around $4. This debugging tool is also compatible with other WCH RISC-V and ARM-based microcontrollers.

![CH32V003_wch-linke.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wagiminator/Development-Boards/main/CH32V003F4P6_DevBoard/documentation/CH32V003_wch-linke.jpg)

To use the WCH-Link on Linux, you need to grant access permissions beforehand by executing the following commands:
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8010", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8012", MODE="666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

On Windows, if you need to you can install the WinUSB driver over the WCH interface 1 using the [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) tool.

To upload firmware, you should disconnect the board from USB and then make the following connections to the WCH-LinkE:

```
WCH-LinkE      MCU Board
+-------+      +------+
|  SWCLK| ---> |CLK   |
|  SWDIO| <--> |DIO   |
|    GND| ---> |GND   |
|    3V3| ---> |VCC   |
+-------+      +------+
```

If the blue LED on the WCH-LinkE remains illuminated once it is connected to the USB port, it means that the device is currently in ARM mode and must be switched to RISC-V mode initially. There are a few ways to accomplish this:
- You can utilize the Python tool [rvprog](https://pypi.org/project/rvprog/) (with -v option).
- Alternatively, you can select "WCH-LinkRV" in the software provided by WCH, such as MounRiver Studio or WCH-LinkUtility.
- Another option is to hold down the ModeS button on the device while plugging it into the USB port.

More information can be found in the [WCH-Link User Manual](http://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/WCH-LinkUserManual_PDF.html).

### WCH-LinkUtility
WCH offers the free but closed-source software [WCH-LinkUtility](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/WCH-LinkUtility_ZIP.html) to upload firmware with Windows using the WCH-LinkE.

### rvprog
You can also use [rvprog](https://pypi.org/project/rvprog/), a simple Python command line tool, to flash the microcontroller via the WCH-LinkE or compatible programmers/debuggers. In order for this tool to work, Python3 and pip must be installed on your system (see chprog above for details). On Linux (Debian-based), all of this can be done with the following commands:

```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip install rvprog
```

```
Usage example:
rvprog -f firmware.bin
```

# Software Development Tools
## MounRiver Studio IDE
The Eclipse-based closed-source [MounRiver Studio IDE](http://www.mounriver.com/) is the official development environment provided by WCH. It supports Windows, Linux, and Mac. MounRiver Studio can be downloaded for free.

## Open-Source GCC Toolchain
You can download a complete toolchain (GCC and OpenOCD) for Linux and Mac from the MounRiver Studio website. However, on Linux you can also install a GCC-based toolchain by running the following command:

```
sudo apt install build-essential libnewlib-dev gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf
```

## Arduino IDE and PlatformIO Support
There are projects around to make the CH32X035 compatible with the Arduino IDE ([arduino_core_ch32](https://github.com/openwch/arduino_core_ch32)) and PlatformIO ([platform-ch32v](https://github.com/Community-PIO-CH32V/platform-ch32v)).
